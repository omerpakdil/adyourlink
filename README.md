## What is adyour.link?

adyour.link is an internet experiment aimed at creating a unique space for link sharing and discovery. Users can purchase individual cells in our 75x200 grid, each representing a link to content they want to share. The cell you purchase becomes your own space. Each time a cell is purchased, the price of the next cell increases by 10 percent.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: The price of each cell increases by 10% with every purchase.
- **Link Details**: Users can view link details in a pop-up when clicking on a purchased cell.
